### Git control
- Decided on having a gitlord with forked projects that would send pull requests to minimize merge problems.
- Added rails project.
- Added partials.
- Fixed up gitignore.
- Added css.
- Added javascript libraries.

### Rails, database and backend
- Added presenter models, routes and database.
- Added date information to the databse.
  - We added a countdown timer to the event from a date set in the database
```
puts Time.new(2016, 07, 17, 10, 0, 0, "+10:00")
```
- Added gem annotate.
```
Annotates Rails/ActiveRecord Models, routes, fixtures, and others based on the database schema.
```
- Project time examples from [Stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5474164/rails-seeding-database-data-and-date-formats).

```
startDate  => DateTime.new(2009,9,1,17)
```
- For the countdown timer we used [Countdown.js](http://countdownjs.org/).
- Used [this reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse) to parse a string into a date object.
- Rails doesnt render the line breaks automatically. We used a [text helper](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/TextHelper.html).

```
<td> <%= simple_format(project.project_description) %></td>
```

`simple_format`
allows you to take line breaks from database (`\n`) and it renders `<br>` tags instead.

### Google Maps integration
- Created a hardcoded address map with google maps from [google developers documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/intro#DistanceMatrixResponses).
- Wanted to remove the [map navigation elements](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/control-disableUI) and add the map direction section to the bottom of the page.

### CSS Frontend
- Added a carousel at the top of the page to display different parts of each project.
- Added hero css.
- First version wifreframes done up in bootstrap.
- Used css keyframes to make neon heading
- Decided to change the sponsors icons to load from grayscale initially to colored on mouse hover.
- Changed using wider logos with text (different width too) to just using squared logos.
- Added some images from [here](https://www.behance.net/laylow) to link with the synthwave/synthpop/cyberpunk theme.
- Added [https://codepen.io/simeydotme/pen/jgcvi](glitter) style overlay to player image profiles because glitter is awesome.
- Added a [http://codepen.io/SitePoint/pen/MwNPVq](javascript countdown clock) in the navbar partial.
- Added a countdown clock to the hero page.
